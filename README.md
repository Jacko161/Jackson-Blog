[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/12283fe2-e6d7-4cae-a8fd-08121d6bcc6a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/tender-goldstine-19b6da/deploys)

This is my dev blog that gets deployed to https://jacksonfleming.dev.

Anything that is on the master branch here is represented on this site, anything in draft mode won't be seen. But since I have open sourced the site, I probably won't be using that feature.
